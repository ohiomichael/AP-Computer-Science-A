Suppose that you have a method printStars, such that printStars(n) prints n stars on one line.  For example a statement

printStars(5);  displays the line *****



(a) Using the printStars method, write a  recursive method printTriangle(n) prints a triangle with one star in the first row, two stars in the second row and so on up to n starts in the last row.  For example, a statement printTriangle(5) should display

(b) Add a method printTriangle2 that will recursively draw the reverse triangle, starting with n stars, and decreasing by one star on each line.  For example 

printTriangle2(5) should display
