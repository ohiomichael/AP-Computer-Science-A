n this lab you will complete the ColorSort file. The program has created a small array containing 5 String values, colors. You are to add a sorting method of your choice (Selection sort is on page 391, Insertion sort is on page 392). These methods will have to be modified slightly as our array is sorting Strings, and these methods, sort doubles. The program should print the original array and then print the sorted array. Add a method to print the contents of the array, horizontally. After printing the sorted array the program should ask the user to input their favorite color. The program should include a sequential search that returns the int index of where the String is found in the array if the array contains the given String and a -1 when the String is not found in the array. The program should use the results of the Sequential search call to print a message stating whether the userâ€™s favorite color was in the list. A sample run of my code is shown on the back of this sheet. Below are 2 sample runs:
