A Flower is defined by three attributes, type of flower, color of flower, and price of flower. For example, one instance of a flower could be a red rose that cost $4.00. Another example of an instance of a flower could be a pink carnation that cost $2.50. Write an external class Flower with fields for type, color, and cost. The class should include a constructor that is sent all three values as parameters, accessor methods for each field and a toString() method. Write a driver class, Bouquet, that creates three different instances of flowers. Include code that will calculate the cost of your three flower bouquet (hint you will need to use the accessor method for price). Use the DecimalFormat class to format the output with a $ and rounding to the hundredths place. Here is an example of my output screen for this project.
